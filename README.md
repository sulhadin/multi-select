## Future Improvements
The project is by no means perfect, and there are a few areas targeted for future improvements:

1. **NPM Package Conversion**: The existing project could be restructured and packed into an easily distributable NPM package.
2. **Improved Folder Structure**: There's scope for improving readability by separating reusable components into a `components` folder and utility functions into a `utils` folder.
3. **Unit Testing Enhancement**: Business logic can be moved to separate files. This will make unit testing easier and more maintainable.
4. **Avoiding Over Engineering**: The above points are not taken into consideration at the moment to keep the project simple and easily understandable while reflecting the basic concept behind the project.
